This is a simple script that prints a graph that shows the distribution of commits in a git repository, grouped by time of day and commiter.

It can be used to determine what times of day each team member commits to the repository.

If you invoke it with no arguments, it will determine the top 5 committers to graph.

You can also pass committer names (git patterns) on the command line to see distributions for specific committers.
